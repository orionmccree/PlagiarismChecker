The program uses cosine_similarity to find the differences and similarity between
two text documents to find if there is any plagiarism.
This creates two vectors from the text documents' raw data, and looks for the
similarities between the two.

When ran, the user will see three lines stating the similarity score between indoors1.txt,
meadow1.txt, and meadow2.txt. If one wishes to test other .txt file scores, then simply
add more .txt files to the root folder and rerun. All .txt files are automatically compared.

To run: python3 main.py

This program requires a Python IDE of some kind to run.
It has been tested with Visual Studio Code.
